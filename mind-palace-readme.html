      <p>
        mind.palace is based on the mnemonic device of visualising one's
        memories as being kept inside distinct locations within a 'mental
        palace', with the act of recalling memories as traversing space within
        that palace to visit or take from those locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app attempts to create a stripped-down digital framework of that
        mnemonic device, packaged in a hybrid theme of programming syntax and
        the metaphor itself: a palace with halls leading to an ever-expanding
        labyrinth of rooms.
